# Mercadoabierto, what is this?
This website is a clone of [mercadolibre](https://mercadolibre.com) called by me as "mercadoabierto". It's one of the best clones out there.

# Why?
The purpose of this project was to practice what was learned in the [nextjs](https://platzi.com/cursos/next/) and [nodejs](https://platzi.com/cursos/practico-node/) courses. Of course, you learn even more along the way than the courses teach, which is normal and reasonable.

Because [mercadolibre](https://mercadolibre.com) have SSR (Server Side Rendering), I decided to make an ecommerce that implements it.

# What can you do in Mercadoabierto?
Well, it's an ecommerce and a marketplace, so you can buy and sell tech products, like smartphones, laptops, smartwatchs, etc. Just [create an account](/signup) and start using it.

# Do you want to see the source code?
Here is the github [repo](https://github.com/coxato/mercadoabierto).
Give me a start in github! (if you like this of course).
