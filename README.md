# mercadoabierto, the mercadolibre clone
This project is a clone of [mercadolibre](https://www.mercadolibre.com/) clone called by me as "mercadoabierto". It's one of the best clones out there.

The purpose of this project was to practice what was learned in the [nextjs](https://platzi.com/cursos/next/) and [nodejs](https://platzi.com/cursos/practico-node/) courses. Of course, you learn even more along the way than the courses teach, which is normal and reasonable.
