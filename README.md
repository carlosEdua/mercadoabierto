# Mercadoabierto, the Mercadolibre clone
This project is a clone of [mercadolibre](https://www.mercadolibre.com/) website called by me as "mercadoabierto". It's one of the best clones out there.

# Live project
**see the project here: [mercadoabierto](https://mercadoabierto.vercel.app/)**

## Why?
The purpose of this project was to practice what was learned in the [nextjs](https://platzi.com/cursos/next/) and [nodejs](https://platzi.com/cursos/practico-node/) courses. Of course, you learn even more along the way than the courses teach, which is normal and reasonable.


## Backend for this project
this is the [backend repo](https://github.com/carlosEdua/mercadoabierto-backend)

## Get started and instalation
comming soon
